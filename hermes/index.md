# Hermes

Hermes is a service providing integration with Speechki CRM to create orders (books) over REST API.

At the moment we don't have a sandbox, so all the integration tests will be made in production environment.


## Requirements

To work with the API you will need:
- a Customer in Speechki CRM;
- a Customer token to call Hermes REST API;
- an endpoint for WebHook which will be receiving requests from our side.


## Customer Token

Customer's admin and manager can create the token. The token has no lifetime limit. For a token to be revoked it must be destroyed.

Token helps us identify the current Customer and user. All of the actions that will be performed with the token will be written under the user owning the token.

HTTP Header — **Authorization**.

Authorization header format — **Token waGpB26t.JXD7RPEHqJVdTCy2AZl7HM0Garmv9DQB**


## Embedded

You can redirect a user to this URL or embed an iframe with it. Recommended minimum width for the iframe is 1200px.

`<iframe src="guest_link" />`

You can read about [*Guest Link*](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/index.md#guest-link) below. 

Additionally to params that guest link contains, you can also append `lang` parameter to change editor language. `...&lang=eng`.
Current available languages:
* `eng` - English

Embed Editor also provides methods to interact with the corresponding Speechki CRM order. In the top bar of the window there would be controls for changing order state (if any is available). 

When editing process is over and the order is closed iframe sends `postMessage` to its parent containing event object in following notation: 

`
  { event: 'speechki-close-editor', data: {} }
`

If there is no data related to the event, data field will be `null`.

For right now there is only one event which signals order closing. 

## Swagger Doc

Up-to-date documentation for the endpoints is available at https://hermes.books.speechki.org/docs.


## Docs

At the moment we have 2 versions API.

[V1](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v1.md) is stable but have fewer features.

[V2](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md) have more feature but not stable at the moment.
