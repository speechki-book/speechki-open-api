#### Fields

**event_type** variants:

- create
- change_state
- build
- book
- voice
- transfer
- other


**type_productions** variants:

- independently
- outsource
- client


## Case 1 (type of production - "client"):

If you have clients who will edit books themselves.

Main different from other type of productions is that editing the book is possible from outside the tracker (see [*Embedded*](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md#embedded))

### Step 1:

These steps need execute before creates orders in the Tracker.

- You need have Customer in Speechki Tracker;
- Set Webhook address in the Customer settings;
- Create API key for your Customer admin or manager. All orders will be created from this user.


### Step 2:

Now you can create orders.

- Take languages list over [endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md#book-languages);
- Now you can take voices list with filter by language over [endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md#speakers);
- After that you can build request body

```json
{
  "url": "https://source.com/test_file.docx",
  "type_productions": "client",
  "details": {
    "name": "Test Book",
    "raw_authors": [
      {
        "first_name": "Frank",
        "last_name": "Herbert"
      }
    ],
    "comment": "Some comment for us",
    "remote_key": "id-from-your-system",
    "speaker": 214,
    "speed": 1,
    "volume": 1,
    "isbnx": "111111111",
    "book_language": "english",
    "style_sheet_link": "https://source.com/style_sheet.json",
    "preview": "https://source.com/preview.jpg"
  }
}

```

We recommend split author name by part. It will help us correct create meta information about the book.

- Send request to the server. Server will return status 202;
- Once the order is created, our system will send notification on Webhook;
- Now you can get information about the order over API with help order ID.


### Step 3

Audio editing.

Next workflow can be different rely on flow which sets for your.

Take the next flow:

None -> Voiced

Voiced -> Complete Order

Previous step:
- You create the order over API;

Current steps:

- After that our system create book and voice it;
- You take information about the order over API [endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md#retrieve-order);
- The order contain field "guest_token_link". If this field is not null you can use this link for redirect to audio editor;
- Audio editing;
- Once you complete audio editing you can push button "complete editing" in editor. Our system will start build book and send notification after complete.

Information about book builds you can get from the order information (*30 days after build*).

If you want to embed editor in to your site use [this](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md#embedded)


## Case 2 (type of production - "outsource"):

If you want that our editors work on books.


### Step 1:

These steps need execute before creates orders in the Tracker.

- You need have Customer in Speechki Tracker;
- Set Webhook address in the Customer settings;
- Create API key for your Customer admin or manager. All orders will be created from this user.


### Step 2:

Now you can create orders.

- Take languages list over [endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/index.md#book-languages);
- Now you can take voices list with filter by language over [endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/index.md#speakers);
- After that you can build request body

```json
{
  "url": "https://source.com/test_file.docx",
  "type_productions": "outsource",
  "details": {
    "name": "Test Book",
    "raw_authors": [
      {
        "first_name": "Frank",
        "last_name": "Herbert"
      }
    ],
    "comment": "Some comment for us",
    "remote_key": "id-from-your-system",
    "speaker": 214,
    "speed": 1,
    "volume": 1,
    "isbnx": "111111111",
    "book_language": "english",
    "style_sheet_link": "https://source.com/style_sheet.json",
    "preview": "https://source.com/preview.jpg"
  }
}

```

We recommend split author name by part. It will help us correct create meta information about the book.

- Send request to the server. Server will return status 202;
- Once the order is created, our system will send notification on Webhook;
- Now you can get information about the order over API with help order ID.


### Step 3:

- Our editors work on the book (audio editing and proofing);
- Once the editors complete work on the order, our system will start build book process and notification after complete;
- You can take information about builds from webhook notification or [order endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md#retrieve-order).


## Case 3 (type of production - "outsource"):

If you want that our editors work on books and your clients review result.

Consider this case with the following flow:

1. None -> New order . Your order created in out system. You will get notification about it on Webhook.
2. New order -> Approved. Our Main Editor approved your book.
3. Approved -> Ready to voice. Our Text Editor prepared book to audio editing.
4. Ready to voice -> Voiced. At this moment your book created and our editors start work under it. You will get notification about it on Webhook.
5. Voiced -> Internal Check. Editor completed work and sends audiobook to Main Editor review.
6. Internal Check -> Voiced. Main Editor finds mistakes and returns book to editor.
7. Internal Check -> Check. Our Main Editor checks audiobook and sends it to client review.
8. Check -> Checked. Client makes review, if he is happy with everything, then sends the order to the next state.
9. Check -> Internal Check. Client makes review, creates corrections in our system and returns the order to our editors. Client has 3 round of corrections.
10. Checked -> Ready to Transfer. We create book builds and check these. You will get notification after create builds on Webhook.
11. Ready to Transfer -> Order complete. We close order. You will get notification about it on Webhook.

We can change order flow depend on your needs. We can add new states or remove old. Because of this we don't recommend hard code flow in your integration.


### How track order progress

You can see on WebHook events. Our system will send notifications after create, voice, build, close order and change state.


#### Order creation

- After order creation our system sends notification on your WebHook;
- You can check [list endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md#list-order) and search your order key in list. This list contain last 20 orders.
- In order details you can see field `book_id` if this field is not null, your book in work.


#### Order in progress

- After the creation of the book and its voice acting you get 2 notification on Webhook. First notification about change state, second about book voicing.


#### Order needs attention

- In [order detail endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md#retrieve-order) you can see field `guest_token_link` if this field is not null then your client can go to the editor and makes actions.
- In [order detail endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md#retrieve-order) you can see field `available_transitions` if this list is not empty your client has right makes transition.


#### Order is completed

- In [order detail endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md#retrieve-order) or Webhook data you can see field `is_completed` if this field is True we completed the order and created builds.


#### Book Builds

- In [order detail endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md#retrieve-order) or Webhook data you can see field `builds` this field contains all builds. You can download every build by link.


### Order Transition limit

  In [order detail endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md#retrieve-order) you can see fields `approvals_count`, `max_approvals_count` and if `max_approvals_count` is not None `current_approval`.
  
  `approvals_count` - Integer. The number of transitions already made.
  `max_approvals_count` - Integer or None. The max number of transition.
  `current_approval` - Optional string. Current round.


### Step 1:

These steps need execute before creates orders in the Tracker.

- You need have Customer in Speechki Tracker;
- Set Webhook address in the Customer settings;
- Create API key for your Customer admin or manager. All orders will be created from this user.


### Step 2:

Now you can create orders.

- Take languages list over [endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/index.md#book-languages);
- Now you can take voices list with filter by language over [endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/index.md#speakers);
- After that you can build request body

```json
{
  "url": "https://source.com/test_file.docx",
  "type_productions": "outsource",
  "details": {
    "name": "Test Book",
    "raw_authors": [
      {
        "first_name": "Frank",
        "last_name": "Herbert"
      }
    ],
    "comment": "Some comment for us",
    "remote_key": "id-from-your-system",
    "speaker": 214,
    "speed": 1,
    "volume": 1,
    "isbnx": "111111111",
    "book_language": "english",
    "style_sheet_link": "https://source.com/style_sheet.json",
    "preview": "https://source.com/preview.jpg"
  }
}

```

We recommend split author name by part. It will help us correct create meta information about the book.

- Send request to the server. Server will return status 202;
- Once the order is created, our system will send notification on Webhook;
- Now you can get information about the order over API with help order ID.


### Step 3:

- Our editors work on the book (audio editing and proofing);
- Main editor checks result and sends book to customer client.


### Step 4

- You take information about the order over API [endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md#retrieve-order);
- The order contain field "guest_token_link". If this field is not null you can use this link for redirect to work with the book;
- Client reviewing the book;
- In first situation client approve result and sends the book to build.
- In second situation client return the book for revision. He can do that 3 times.


### Step 5

- We create the book builds and close the order. After every these actions you get Webhook notification.
