#### Fields

**event_type** variants:

- create
- change_state
- build
- book
- voice
- transfer
- other
- error


**type_productions** variants:

- independently
- outsource
- client


## Case 1 (type of production - "client"):

If you have clients who will edit books themselves.

Main different from other type of productions is that editing the book is possible from outside the tracker (see [*Embedded*](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/index.md#embedded))

### Step 1:

These steps need execute before creates orders in the Tracker.

- You need have Customer in Speechki Tracker;
- Set Webhook address in the Customer settings;
- Create API key for your Customer admin or manager. All orders will be created from this user.


### Step 2:

Now you can create orders.

- Take languages list over [endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/index.md#book-languages);
- Now you can take voices list with filter by language over [endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/index.md#speakers);
- After that you can build request body

```json
{
  "url": "https://source.com/test_file.docx",
  "type_productions": "client",
  "details": {
    "name": "Test Book",
    "raw_authors": [
      {
        "first_name": "Frank",
        "last_name": "Herbert"
      }
    ],
    "comment": "Some comment for us",
    "remote_key": "id-from-your-system",
    "speaker": 214,
    "speed": 1,
    "volume": 1,
    "isbnx": "111111111",
    "book_language": "english"
  }
}

```

We recommend split author name by part. It will help us correct create meta information about the book.

- Send request to the server. Server will return status 202;
- Once the order is created, our system will send notification on Webhook;
- Now you can get information about the order over API with help order ID.


### Step 3

Audio editing.

Next workflow can be different rely on flow which sets for your.

Take the next flow:

None -> Voiced

Voiced -> Complete Order

Previous step:
- You create the order over API;

Current steps:

- After that our system create book and voice it;
- You take information about the order over API [endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/index.md#retrieve-order);
- The order contain field "guest_token_link". If this field is not null you can use this link for redirect to audio editor;
- Audio editing;
- Once you complete audio editing you can push button "complete editing" in editor. Our system will start build book and send notification after complete.

Information about book builds you can get from the order information (*30 days after build*).

If you want to embed editor in to your site use [this](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/index.md#embedded)


## Case 2 (type of production - "outsource"):

If you want that our editors work on books.


### Step 1:

These steps need execute before creates orders in the Tracker.

- You need have Customer in Speechki Tracker;
- Set Webhook address in the Customer settings;
- Create API key for your Customer admin or manager. All orders will be created from this user.


### Step 2:

Now you can create orders.

- Take languages list over [endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/index.md#book-languages);
- Now you can take voices list with filter by language over [endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/index.md#speakers);
- After that you can build request body

```json
{
  "url": "https://source.com/test_file.docx",
  "type_productions": "outsource",
  "details": {
    "name": "Test Book",
    "raw_authors": [
      {
        "first_name": "Frank",
        "last_name": "Herbert"
      }
    ],
    "comment": "Some comment for us",
    "remote_key": "id-from-your-system",
    "speaker": 214,
    "speed": 1,
    "volume": 1,
    "isbnx": "111111111",
    "book_language": "english"
  }
}

```

We recommend split author name by part. It will help us correct create meta information about the book.

- Send request to the server. Server will return status 202;
- Once the order is created, our system will send notification on Webhook;
- Now you can get information about the order over API with help order ID.


### Step 3:

- Our editors work on the book (audio editing and proofing);
- Once the editors complete work on the order, our system will start build book process and notification after complete;
- You can take information about builds from webhook notification or [order endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/index.md#retrieve-order).
