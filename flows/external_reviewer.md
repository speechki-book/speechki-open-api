# External reviewer

Speechki editors are responsible for proofreading. Authors are responsible for checking the results.

The Author has 3  rounds of corrections. Then, they have only one option - accept proof and all the corrections made.


The User has access to the editor only when the order in the "check" status. In this situation when you receive order details you can see the field called **guest_token_link** and this field is not longer null.


## Order Transition limit

  In [order detail endpoint](https://github.com/speechki-book/speechki-open-api/blob/master/hermes/v2.md#retrieve-order) you can see fields `approvals_count`, `max_approvals_count` and if `max_approvals_count` is not None `current_approval`.
  
  `approvals_count` - Integer. The number of transitions already made.
  `max_approvals_count` - Integer or None. The max number of transition.
  `current_approval` - Optional string. Current round.


## Statuses:
- approved (Text preparation)
- ready_to_voice (Text review)
- record (Recording in progress)
- record_in_progress (Recording is broken and the Speechki team is working on it)
- voiced (Audio editing)
- internal_check (Internal review)
- check (The audiobook is on the author review)
- build (Final export is in progress)
- build_in_progress (Final export is broken and the Speechki team is working it)
- order_completed (The order is completed)
